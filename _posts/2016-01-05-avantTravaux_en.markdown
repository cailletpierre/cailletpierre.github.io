Here are some photos of the house just before the beginning of the construction works:

The terrace, with the entrance door. Soon three windows for the bedrooms will be opened on the first floor:

The wall between the two rooms. It will be detroyed in a few days, to create a big living room:

The old chimney. Even if we can't do fire inside any more (we have a big wood boiler for the whole house), we decided to preserve it, since it's nice in the living room:
