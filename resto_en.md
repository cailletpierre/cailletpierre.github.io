Our favourite restaurants (be careful to call before to go):

=============================

We are really loving this one. Roselyne and Dominique are very nice. The kitchen is completely opened, so you can see Roselyne while she's cooking.
When I was young, the boss was her father. She continues the business with her husband, it's a really nice story.


- The Austrasius (10 minutes away,in Beaulieu en Argonne)
==============================

Xavier, the boss, is from our family. You will enjoy his kindness and availability. Moreover, he's also a real farmer. Sometimes on saturday evening or sunday afternoon, Xavier organizes concerts, which are very crowdy.
